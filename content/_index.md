## GIS Nerd with a Physics and Math background

Hi! I'm Aurora, a trans girl making her way in Chicago, the big bean. I just moved up here and am looking to start a career in GIS, my true passion, I have formal education in physics and math, but a lot of passionate self taught experience using GIS software. This website serves as both a place to host my resume and display my portfolio
