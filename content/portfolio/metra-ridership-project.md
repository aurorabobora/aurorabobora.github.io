A friend recently shared [an interesting article](https://citythatworks.substack.com/p/build-the-tunnel) with me which discussed their proposal for a set of cost effective measures to improve transit in the Chicago region. The article titled "Build the tunnel" supposes that significant expansions to the CTA L network, beyond the Red Line extension to 130th St, are inplausible in our current transit landscape. Their solution, unsurpisingly, was to #BuildTheTunnel, two in fact, one under Columbus and Ohio connecting the Metra Electric 18th St station to the three Metra Union Pacific lines just north of Ogilvie, and the other under Clinton connecting the BNSF line to the UP lines. I have included their map below for visual clarity.

I found this proposal fairly compelling, it is well established that transit capital costs in America are out of control. The Red Line Extension is shaping up to be one of the most expensive per mile of any subway project in the country. Barring wholesale reform of transit funding in this country, we will need to invest in precise and tacticle projects to improve service. Essentially, the article proposes that if we build 5.25 miles (slightly less than the RLE) of tunnel through downtown, it would allow us to optimize how we utilize our extensive existing infrastructure. Today Metra serves suburbanites who want to get downtown, and provides dissapointing service for folks trying to get around the city. This proposal would see the addition of "Crosstowner" service (Similar to the RER or S-Bahn), along the Metra ROW. This new Crosstowner service would utilize the new tunnels and a few infill stations in the city to unlock the potential of our existing regional rail network. They would provide a conveinient service for suburbanites travelling thru Chicago and a quicker way for Chicagoans to get to the further stretches of their city. They also propose that these Crosstowners would take over service to many of Metra's current inner ring suburb stations, allowing Metra trains to much more quickly ferry Aurorans and Elginers into the city.

This seems like an excellent use of our limited capital budget to me, but it left me with a lot of questions about the current use patterns of the Metra network. When studying their proposed routing options, I wanted to have a visual reference for what stations were more used and why they chose to certain service patterns for the crosstowners, and why the chose the stations to continue receiving metra service that they did
